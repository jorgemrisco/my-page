A full-stack software developer (with a special love for back-end systems) based in Brazil 🇧🇷 with an ironic high sensitivity to caffeine ☕.

I enjoy working out 🏋️, playing strategy games 🧩(such as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/" target="_blank">EUIV</a>) and I've been trying to get into running as a way to relax and keep a healthy lifestyle, my pacing isn't quite good to be shared here but I'll be working on it on the following months. 🏃

I've been deeply involved on a range of different projects spanning from banking systems to digital marketplaces.
